The "Encryption and Decryption Tool using Tkinter" is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that provides functionalities for various encryption and decryption techniques. It offers encryption methods such as Caesar Cipher, Atbash Cipher, Affine Cipher, Vigen√®re Cipher, and Playfair Cipher. Users can input their text and select the desired encryption or decryption method from a dropdown menu, allowing them to encrypt or decrypt messages easily.

The application features a user-friendly interface built using Tkinter, providing a text input area, dropdown selection for different encryption methods, encryption and decryption buttons, and output display areas. Users can encrypt or decrypt text based on their chosen method, seeing the output directly on the GUI.

Additionally, the tool ensures a fixed window size, restricting resizing, and incorporates a background image for an enhanced visual experience. The GUI includes a footer displaying a signature "Made by Soumya Darshan" to credit the creator.

This project aims to offer a simple yet comprehensive tool for users to explore and understand different encryption techniques in a visually appealing and accessible manner.
